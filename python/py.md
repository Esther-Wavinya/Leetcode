### Critical ideas to remember
Always ask the following questions related to input for every coding problem:
- What is the size of input? like 10 0r 1000 or 10billion!
- What is the **data type** of input? It can be an integer, floating-point number, character, string or boolean.
- How input values are stored? It can be stored in a data structure like an array, linked list, tree, graph, etc.
- Is there some information available for the distribution of input? Like values can be stored in sorted order, input is allowed in a certain range, some permutation of the input is allowed only, etc.
